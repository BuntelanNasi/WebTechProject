          Hello everyone! My name is Dylan Hugo Sajino and welcome to my food
          blog! I am an avid eater and thus what better way to eat good food
          than cooking your own! My love for cooking started when I wanted to
          lose more weight. I realised that a lot of so called "diet food" is
          very bland and I thought that it would never be sustainable for me to
          keep eating "diet food" to lose weight and achieve my fitness goals.
          That is when I thought of cooking my own food so that I can control I
          can track my calories and macronutrients intake through my own cooked
          food.
          <br />
          Makan bareng means to eat together in Indonesian. In this blog, I will
          be uploading my own simple recipes that have saved me when I dont have
          much time to cook and even more complicated recipes that require more
          time to show off your friends/family that you can cook. If you are a
          college student who wants simple recipes to cook with your limited
          time or someone who is looking for recipes to spice up their cooking,
          you have come to the right place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Have fun and <span class="makan">"mari kita makan bareng".</span>
